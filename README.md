# nose-mock-talk
Talk given by Code Lane about Nose and Mock

A simplified intro to using Python Nose and Mocks in your unit tests.

This talk will discuss how to setup/configure Nose and Mock for unit testing in python.  The example demonstrated in this talk will be a library written in python that compares a SemVer (http://semver.org/) to another and report equality comparisons.  

• We will focus on code contained in this repository: 

• https://github.com/codylane/python-semantic.git

• We will focus on python version 2.7.x

Agenda:

• How to setup code coverage.  

• How to measure your test coverage. 

• Provide examples of current unit tests without mocks.

• Provide example of current unit tests with mocks.

If time permits, we will discuss a form of TDD and create some additional unit tests for a complex recursive method.
